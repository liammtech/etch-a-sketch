SQUARE RENDERING
- Radio buttons control number of divs rendered to pallette (e.g. 32 => 32 x 32 squares)
- Defaults to 32
- Upon content load, populate with default number of squares
- Upon button select, redraw "clean" grid

SQUARE INTERACTION
- On mouseover, "highlight" a square - and keep highlighted
- So as you're "drawing", it's adding a highlighted class to the squares
